# Docstring Generation Rule

When creating or editing code, please ensure that comprehensive docstrings are included for all functions, classes, and methods.

Docstrings should clearly explain:
- The purpose of the code block.
- The arguments it takes (if any), including their types and what they represent.
- What the code block returns (if anything), including its type and meaning.
- Any exceptions that might be raised.

This practice is crucial for maintaining code readability and facilitating collaboration.

Additionally, if during the process of editing a file, the purpose of other functions or structs (even in different files) becomes clear, proactively add docstrings to them as well.
